# EVM OPCODE Gas Costs

This repo organizes info about and tracks changes to OPCODE gas costs in the [Ethereum Yellow Paper](http://yellowpaper.io/).

Click on a CSV in the browser and github does a pretty good job displaying it, or pull down the repo to use locally.

This project started at EIP 150 and will build out new CSVs as new versions of the protocol are released (e.g. Metropolis!). I also plan on going back and building out previous versions, especially if there is some demand and/or help in doing so.

## Google Spreadsheets

For those of you that prefer a google spreadsheet, I will be maintaining a corresponding google spreadsheet per EIP update

Any and all help is welcome. Please submit a pull request with any corrections or additions with an explanation.

## Disclaimer

This repo aspires to have correct and up to date info on gas costs of EVM OPCODEs, but if ever in doubt, the [yellow paper](http://yellowpaper.io/) is the ultimate truth and source of info. *Use at your own risk*.
